# Browser Directory Explorer

A minimal file management application for exploring and managing files through the browser.

## Features

- Browse directories and files
- Rename files and folders
- Delete files and folders
- Navigation history (back/forward)
- Clean, minimal UI with subtle animations

## Note

This is currently a demo version with mock file system implementation. In a real-world scenario, this would require a backend service to interact with the actual file system.

## Running the application

```
npm run dev
```

Access the application at http://localhost:8080
